# 🔬 Malware Analysis Sandbox (FlareVM)

## Environment Design

The sandbox is a dedicated Windows 10 VM running **Mandiant’s FlareVM** distribution. It is hosted on VirtualBox with specific hardening:

- **Host-Only Networking:** Physically isolated from the home LAN.
- **Service Simulation:** Internal routing to a listener (Wireshark) to capture callback attempts without live internet access.
  - Sometimes this has to be mocked up a different way with more clever malware that detect these analysis attempts.

## Typical Tooling Workflow

1. **Initial Triage:** Hash lookup via **VirusTotal API**.
2. **Static Analysis:** PEStudio for header inspection and FLOSS for string deobfuscation.
3. **Dynamic Analysis:** Behavior monitoring with Procmon and Regshot.
